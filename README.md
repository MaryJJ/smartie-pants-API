# Smartie Pants Placements

Smartie Pants Placements is a project to manage placements in [Unity](https://unity.com/) plataform, the system allows us to access information through a REST API.

Basic Actions:

- Create a user and login.
- Create and update placements in Unity.
- Visualize the response from Unity API after creating or updating placements.

This project is a [ASP .Net Core 3.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals) REST API, it uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as a database and works independently of the visual client, we recommended using the visual interface you will find [here](https://github.com/MaryJJ/smartie-pants-WebApp)

Demo online: (the online demo when first loaded may take a while as the project is hosted on a free dino on Heroku and this dino falls asleep if it has no activity so the first load needs to reactivate the dino.)
